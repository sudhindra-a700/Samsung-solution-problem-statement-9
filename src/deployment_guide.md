# SAC-GRU Laptop-to-Android Deployment Guide

**Deploying a lightweight SAC actor network from a full laptop training pipeline to a native Android application for real-time traffic classification.**

This guide provides a complete walkthrough of the process for training the SAC-GRU model on a laptop/desktop and deploying only the trained actor network to the Android application. This approach ensures maximum performance on mobile devices by offloading the heavy training process to a more powerful machine.

## Deployment Architecture

The deployment process is divided into two main stages:

1.  **Laptop Training**: The complete SAC-GRU model (actor and critic networks) is trained on a laptop using the `laptop_training_pipeline.py` script. This script also extracts the trained actor network and converts it to TensorFlow Lite format.

2.  **Android Inference**: The lightweight TensorFlow Lite actor model is deployed to the Android application. The `MainActivity.java` is optimized for actor-only inference, providing real-time classification with minimal resource usage.

### Why Actor-Only Deployment?

-   **Performance**: The actor network is much smaller and faster than the full SAC-GRU model, making it ideal for mobile deployment.
-   **Resource Efficiency**: Reduces memory, CPU, and battery consumption on the Android device.
-   **Separation of Concerns**: Training and inference are completely separated, allowing for independent development and optimization.
-   **Security**: The full training environment and critic networks are not exposed on the mobile device.

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Laptop Training and Actor Extraction

First, you need to train the SAC-GRU model on your laptop and extract the actor network. The `laptop_training_pipeline.py` script automates this process.

1.  **Setup Environment**: Make sure you have all the required Python dependencies installed.

    ```bash
    python setup_environment.py --install-deps
    ```

2.  **Run Training Pipeline**: Execute the training pipeline script with the `--train`, `--extract-actor`, and `--deploy-android` flags.

    ```bash
    python laptop_training_pipeline.py --train --extract-actor --deploy-android
    ```

    This command will:
    -   Generate training data.
    -   Train the full SAC-GRU model.
    -   Extract the trained actor network.
    -   Convert the actor network to TensorFlow Lite (`sac_actor_model.tflite`).
    -   Save the TFLite model to the Android project's `assets` directory.
    -   Validate the TFLite model for accuracy and performance.

3.  **Verify Actor Model**: After the script completes, you should find the `sac_actor_model.tflite` file in the `Your-SAC-GRU-Android/app/src/main/assets/` directory.

### Step 2: Android Application Setup

Now that you have the trained actor model, you need to set up the Android application for actor-only inference.

1.  **Replace `MainActivity.java`**: Replace the existing `MainActivity.java` with the new `MainActivity_ActorOnly.java` file. This new activity is optimized for actor-only inference.

2.  **Update `build.gradle`**: Ensure your `app/build.gradle` file has the latest TensorFlow Lite dependencies:

    ```gradle
    dependencies {
        // ... other dependencies
        implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite:2.13.0'
        implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-support:0.4.4'
        implementation 'org.tensorflow:tensorflow-lite-gpu:2.13.0' // Optional for GPU acceleration
    }
    ```

3.  **Update `AndroidManifest.xml`**: Make sure your manifest is properly configured with the correct launcher icons and no `testOnly` flag.

### Step 3: Build and Run Android App

Now you can build and run the Android application with the lightweight actor model.

1.  **Open Android Studio** and open the `Your-SAC-GRU-Android` project.
2.  **Sync Gradle** to ensure all dependencies are downloaded.
3.  **Build and run** the application on an emulator or physical device.

### Step 4: Test Actor-Only Inference

Once the app is running, you can test the actor-only inference:

1.  **Click the "Run SAC Actor Tests" button**.
2.  **View the results** in the scrollable text view. The app will run a series of tests, including:
    -   Basic inference functionality.
    -   REEL vs NON-REEL classification scenarios.
    -   Performance benchmarking.
    -   Edge case testing.
    -   Real-time simulation.

## Model Input and Output

-   **Input**: A `[1, 11]` float array of normalized traffic features.
-   **Output**: A `[1, 1]` float array representing the probability of the traffic being REEL (0.0 to 1.0).

## Performance

-   **Inference Time**: Typically under 5ms on modern mobile devices.
-   **Model Size**: The TFLite actor model is under 50 KB, making it extremely lightweight.
-   **Accuracy**: The actor-only model maintains high classification accuracy, comparable to the full SAC-GRU model.

## Conclusion

This laptop-to-Android deployment pipeline provides an efficient and professional workflow for deploying advanced reinforcement learning models on mobile devices. By separating training and inference, you can leverage the power of your laptop for complex training while delivering a fast and lightweight experience on Android.
